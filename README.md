# GoLang-BFSMazeSolver
Very crude BFS 2D Maze Solver

Maze is stored as a 2D array of 1s and 0s. 1 indicates a maze wall, 0 indicates a path.
Used a breadth-first search to find the quickest path between 2 points in the maze (top left to bottom right in the test case)

This is the (crude) basis for more involved project Im working on.
